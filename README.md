# Streamlit Statistics

This project is a small Streamlit application demonstrating the
**Central Limit Theorem**.

The app shows how the distribution of sample means converges to a
normal distribution as sample size increases, regardless of the
underlying data distribution.

## How to run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
